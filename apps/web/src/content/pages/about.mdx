## WHO AM I

I am Backend Developer in Ukraine. I am 18 years old and I am learning Rust, TypeScript and database management. Now I have a passion for learning C#.

I started learning server-side development in July 2019 (I was 13 years old). It's a big challenge because it's just one of my hobbies and I haven't taken any courses yet. I've been self-studying on Discord and YouTube. One of my favorite Discord guilds is [The Programmer's Hangout](https://discord.gg/programming). There I learned a lot of server side development skills and more.

I love to use [Actix](https://actix.rs) to create webapps. Then I use [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) to host my codebase. After that I use [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to deploy my webapp OR on any host (VDS, VPS, AMAZON and others).
